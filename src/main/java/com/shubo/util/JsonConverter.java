/**
 * Java can perform buffering which means that it will hold onto data written in memory until
 * it has a certain amount, and then write it all to the file in one go which is more efficient.
 * The downside of this is that the file is not necessarily up-to-date at any given time.
 * Flush is a way of saying "make the file up-to-date.

 * Close calls flush first to ensure that after closing the file has what you would
 * expect to see in it, hence as others have pointed out, no need to flush before closing.
